Hey Sir/Mam,

I wanted to tell you something. I decided to use Provider instead of Bloc for this one because currently I'm working on Bloc so I used Provider in this project. Despite this, I managed to complete the project in under 4.5 hours, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

I made sure the web app is responsive, meaning it looks good and works well on different devices. Plus, I integrated Hive database to store all the data locally, making it easy to access and manage. On top of that, I set up a websocket connection to interact with the server, allowing for real-time updates and smoother communication.

One feature I'm particularly excited about is the chat functionality. Users can create different chat sessions and interact with the server in real-time. It's a cool way to engage with the content and make the user experience more interactive.

Unfortunately, due to my current workload with final exams and internship presentations, I couldn't add more functionalities. But I'm definitely open to feedback and suggestions for future improvements.

If you'd like to check out the web app or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via email at purvangsuvagiya@gmail.com. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
